-   Authors: Abhiket Gaurav, Berkay Bulut, Kyle Ahn, Morgan Rosenberg

### Overview:
Employee wellbeing is a major concern in today's corporate world. Many employees quit their jobs as they find the work pressure to be too high, or company culture not suitable to their needs. It is commonly known in industry that to replace even the most junior employee is upwards of 25% of their annual salary; this figure only increases as seniority increases.

This dashboard will help employers view and understand the health of their employee base to then take proactive steps to keep their employees happy, healthy, and 'here' (retained). It can be used to monitor employee's work life quality in multiple dimensions such as their overall feeling, workshop preference and meaninfulness at work.

## Explanation
This app is an executive summary of surveys that were conducted to identify the employees' quality of work life. On the top left corner, the name of the company, BEI Vita, is shown to represent where this dashboard belongs to. On the top centre, the name of the client that this dashboard is built for is included. The app contains a landing page that shows the distribution of important variables such as "contributor of employees' quality of work life", "ratings of employees feeling acknowledgment", and "total score of employees' quality of work life". On the top right corner, there are filters for users to select the relevant demographics and regions (i.e. survey results only from Japan). On the centre right, we have one label, "Average Score", which summarises all the data into a single KPI value for swift interpretation. On the very far right, there is a scroll bar to allow users to scroll up and down to view more content. Overall, this app offers a holistic view of the employees' quality of work life in one simple dashboard.
